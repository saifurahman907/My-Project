          <h3>True news example</h3>
          <p>
            World leaders who attended the king s funeral on Sunday used the
            occasion for an intensive round of meetings centred on pushing
            forward the Middle East peace process. President Clinton, the
            Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser
            Arafat met for three-way discussions that American officials said
            were brief but animated. Palestinian officials said Mr Arafat and Mr
            Barak will meet again on Tuesday to discuss Israeli implementation
            of existing peace accords. UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had
            meetings with the Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian leaders. The new
            Israeli Prime Minister was building diplomatic bridges Contrary to
            Israeli predictions, there was no encounter between Mr Barak and the
            Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, because Mr Assad stayed at home.
            Landmark meetings There were other diplomatic landmarks. The new
            President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, shook hands with Mr
            Barak - a first for a country officially still at war with Israel.
            President Mubarak: A key player in the peace process Another key
            player in the Middle East peace process, the Egyptian President
            Hosni Mubarak, had a series of meetings at the funeral, including
            one with Mr Barak. President Bouteflika, for his part, took the
            opportunity to hold talks with Morocco s new King Muhammad after the
            funeral - moving swiftly to improve relations between the two
            countries, officials said. The Algerian leader was accompanied by a
            high-level delegation, including his Prime Minister Smail Hamdani,
            underlining the importance he attached to the occasion. US President
            Clinton stayed in Rabat well after nightfall, to meet various
            leaders from the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But by Monday, most
            of the presidents, prime ministers and kings had left Morocco,
            leaving behind pledges of support for the new king. Frenzied scenes
            King Hassan died of a heart attack on Friday. He was the Arab world
            s longest-serving head of state. In all, representatives of more
            than 50 countries came to pay their final respects to the king.
            There were frenzied scenes of mourning by some of the 2m people
            estimated to have come to catch a glimpse of the king s coffin. The
            Muslim tradition, which says that burial should take place within 24
            hours of death, was waived to allow so many foreign guests to
            attend. Government sources said on Sunday that King Muhammad VI, as
            he will be styled, got married in a quiet ceremony on the day his
            father died. According to Moroccan tradition, the crown prince must
            be married so that he can ascend the throne, a source told the
            Reuters news agency. Other reports said the Palace denied the
            wedding took place.

            Zambian locals ran away in terror when they saw a strange human-like
            figure appear in the clouds above a shopping centre. The alleged
            apparition, which looked like a Dementor from the Harry Potter
            movies, was spotted above the Mukuba Mall in Kitwe. Photographs show
            a large humanoid head and torso, tailing into the sky and it is
            thought to have measured more than 100 metres (330ft) long. A
            strange human-like figure appeared above Mukuba Mall in Kitwe,
            Zambia. Some started worshipping it and others ran away in terror
            Photographs show a large humanoid head and torso, tailing into the
            sky and it is thought to have measured more than 100 metres (330ft)
            long The dense black shape looked like it was made from a different
            material from the clouds. From the angle of the photograph, it looks
            like the apparition was looking down on the shopping centre. The
            figure hung in the sky for about half an hour and some thought it
            was a manifestation of God. A witness said: We were shocked to see
            images that looked like a human in the clouds for close to 30
            minutes. Some started worshipping but others ran away. It was so
            strange.
